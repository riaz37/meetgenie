#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of all recorded meetings with basic metadata
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality by date, topic, and participant
3. WHEN selecting a meeting THEN the system SHALL display the full transcript, summary, and Q&A history
